# InferCNV

<!--  code for by patient assignment: see prior to 21-Jan-2022 00:17:11 -->

We have suspicions regarding which clusters are likely to be tumor
cells, but we're not certain. In particular the Chondrocyte/Mesenchymal
cluster was unclear, they might well be healthy cells.

Some tumor cells harbour chromosomal amplifications or deletions that
can be detected by looking for stretches of adjacent genes that on
average appear to be all up or all down, relative to a
reference. [infercnv](https://github.com/broadinstitute/inferCNV) is a
tool to do this.  It needs healthy cells as a reference. We can use the
cells with a clear, definite cell type that is present in tidy clusters
in which several patients are represented.  The monocytes and T-, NK-,
and B cells we found with SingleR are quite suitable for this.

## Preparing the data

inferCNV needs the data in a special format, let's do that first

```{r prepare-infercnv}

## overview of numbers per celltype:
table(srat@meta.data$type2)

## which cells do we think we can trust as being healthy:
ref_types <- c("T", "NK", "B", "Mono")

## overview of this:
maybe_tumor <- !(srat@meta.data$type2 %in% ref_types)
table( maybe_tumor )

## infercnv needs them as an external data file in a specific format,
## create that:
df <- data.frame(cell=colnames(srat), type=srat@meta.data$type2)

celltypes_file <- paste0(CFG$output_dir,"/celltypes.txt")
write.table(df, file=celltypes_file, sep="\t", 
  quote=FALSE, na="", row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE)

## infercnv also needs to gene coordinates, in the tab-delimited format
##  genename chrNN START END. 
## We can use the `genecoords` object from SCutils for this.

## this data needs some cleaning. Use only the canonical chromosomes,
## sort them, get rid of duplicates and put 'chr' in front of the chromosome:
wanted.chr <- c( as.character(1:22), "X", "Y") # skip MT and KI2707 etc.
geneorder <- genecoords[ genecoords$chr %in% wanted.chr,  ]
geneorder$numeric_chr <- as.numeric(geneorder$chr)
geneorder[ geneorder$chr %in% 'X', 'numeric_chr' ] <- 30
geneorder[ geneorder$chr %in% 'Y', 'numeric_chr' ] <- 40
geneorder <- geneorder[ order(geneorder$numeric_chr, geneorder$start), ]
geneorder <- geneorder[!duplicated(geneorder$gene_name), ]
geneorder <- with(geneorder,
                  data.frame(gene=gene_name,
                             chromosome=paste0('chr', chr),
                             start=start, end=end))

geneorder_file <- paste0(CFG$output_dir, "/geneorder.txt")
write.table(geneorder, file=geneorder_file, sep="\t",
            row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE,
            quote=FALSE, na="")

raw_counts <- GetAssayData(srat, assay='RNA', slot='counts')

common <- intersect(rownames(raw_counts), geneorder$gene)

## set up the infercnv object with all necessary information:
infercnv_obj <- infercnv::CreateInfercnvObject(delim="\t",
      raw_counts_matrix=raw_counts[common, ] ,
      annotations_file=celltypes_file,
      gene_order_file=geneorder_file,
      ref_group_name = ref_types )

## free up space before we start:
gc()

```

## Run inferCNV

```{r infercnv-run}

## infercnv writes its output to disk. It is a fair amount,
## so let's create a separate directory for that and write
## it there:
outdir <- paste0(CFG$output_dir, "/infercnv")
dir.create(outdir)

## running takes can take up to 10 min, best start this before the lecture:
infercnv_obj <- infercnv::run(infercnv_obj,
                             out_dir=outdir,
                             cluster_by_groups=TRUE, 
                             denoise=TRUE,
                             analysis_mode = "samples",
                             num_threads = 3,
                             output_format = "png",
                             window_length = 101,
                             save_final_rds = TRUE,
                             plot_steps=FALSE, 
                             cutoff=0.1, 
                             sd_amplifier = 1.5,
                             HMM=FALSE)

## plot_steps=TRUE may lead to weird crash, see github
## cutoff: min average read counts per gene for reference cells
## sd_amplifier: noise threshold. Higher: less noise but also less signal.

```

<!-- Jeff used cutoff 0.3, sd=2; Thanasis used cutoff 0.1, sd 1.5  -->
<!-- {r include-cnv-plot, echo = TRUE, out.width="30%" include=FALSE } -->
<!-- following is needed to get the plot into the knitted product as it is external! -->

```{r copyoutput, include=FALSE }

png <- list.files(outdir, pattern = "^infercnv.png$", full.names = TRUE)
file.copy(png, "figure/", overwrite=TRUE)

```

## Results

The script does not produce output to the *Plots* tab of RStudio, but instead
writes directly to disk, in directory `outdir` that we just created. 
You can access this folder in the *Files* tab. There you can see, 
amongst others, the file `infercnv.png`, which contains the final
inferCNV plot.  You should be able to open it by clicking.

It should look like

![infercnv](figure/infercnv.png)

<!-- Discuss the HLA cluster ( chr6, p21.3, halfway p-arm) 

ESC-2+3 are patient 410;  close together

ESC-6+7 are patient GRN (note the split, prolly artefact)

ESC-0 is patient 'CPU'
-->

**Exercise 1:** Are the reference data chosen well? (if you doubt this, you can of course redo the calculation with a different set of refence cells)

<!-- answer: more or less -->

**Exercise 2:** What can you say about the Chondrocyte / Mesenchymal cluster?

<!-- seem healthy, based on CNV's -->

## Score per cell

Judging by eye it seems safe to say that the majority of non-reference
cells are indeed tumor.  However, it would be very useful to have a
score per cell indicating the degree to which it is aneuploid (i.e., has
the correct number of chromosomes).

InferCNV does not currently produce such a score (unless you use the
HMM option, which takes very long). However, there is an
easy way to get something similar, something we call the aneuploidy score.

It is simply the total number of genes in long stretches (say > 70
genes) whose *Modified Expression* (i.e. what you seen in the heatmap)
is further away from the mean than e.g. 1.5 standard deviations. Jurrian
de Kanter provided code to easily calculate this using R's `rle`
function (see `?rle` for details).

We calculate the for reference (healthy) and observation (maybe tumor)
separately so that we compare their distributions (e.g. using the
*t*-statistic, and maybe optimize the parameters.  This also allows us
to select a hard cutoff for the aneuploidy score that could distinguish
between tumor and healthy, should this be needed.

The *Modified Expression* values are stored in `infercnv_obj` in the
slot `expr.data`.  This matrix contains *all* the data, so we have to
extract the relevant cells. Their indexes (grouped by cluster name) are
given in `infercnv_obj@reference_grouped_cell_indices` and
`infercnv_obj@observation_grouped_cell_indices` (as integers, not cell
names ...)

```{r prep-aneuploidy}

refexp <- infercnv_obj@expr.data[ , unname(unlist(infercnv_obj@reference_grouped_cell_indices)) ]

obsexp <- infercnv_obj@expr.data[ , unname(unlist(infercnv_obj@observation_grouped_cell_indices)) ]

## now scale them so that SD is the 'unit' of Modif. Expression:
obs.scaled <- scale(obsexp)
ref.scaled <- scale(refexp)

## trick by Jurrian de Kanter
.count_genes_in_runs <- function (x, length=50, SDs=2) {
  ## count total number of genes in stretches longer than LENGTH 
  ## exceeding SDs std.devs from mean. 
  runs <- rle(x > SDs)
  up <- sum(runs$lengths[ runs$lengths>length & runs$values])
  runs <- rle(x <   -SDs)
  down <- sum(runs$lengths[ runs$lengths>length & runs$values])
  ## (don't use abs(x) >  because pos and neg stretches might overlap, so partly cancel)
  sum(up,down)
} # .count_genes_in_runs

aneuploidy_score <- function(adj_expr,
                     length = 70,
                     SDs = 1.5) {
  apply(adj_expr, 2, .count_genes_in_runs, length=length, SDs=SDs)
}  ## aneuploidy_score

```

## Choosing a cutoff

We can now plot the distributions of the aneuploidy scores and tweak the
`adj_expr` and `length` arguments to optimize the discrimination between
tumor and healthy. We use the *t*-statistic as a measure of separation
between both distributions.

```{r calc-score}

len <- 50 # also try e.g. 30 or 70
SDs <- 1.3 # also try e.g. 1.5 or 2
obsscore <-  aneuploidy_score(obs.scaled, length=len)
refscore <-  aneuploidy_score(ref.scaled, SDs=SDs)

ttest <- t.test(obsscore, refscore)

plot(density(obsscore), 
      main=sprintf("Aneuploidy score length=%d SDs=%.1f",len, SDs),
      xlab=sprintf("t=%.2f", ttest$statistic))
rug(obsscore, ticksize=0.01)
rug(refscore, ticksize= -0.01, col='red')
lines(density(refscore), col='red')
legend(x="topright", legend=c('tumor', 'reference'), col=c('black','red'),
       pch=NULL, lty=1, bty='n')

```

The curves for tumor and reference should be well separated and should be
unimodal (one peak). If you see more than one peak or a shoulder
(especially in the reference curve), that is a sign that your reference
and tumor cells were assigned wrongly in the Singler practical. In that
case you have to redo the assignment and run inferCNV again.

<!-- 
## len <- 70
## SDs <- 1.5 => 
gives t=40.4
-->

## Choosing a cutoff for the aneuploidy score.

It is useful to add the aneuploidy score to the meta data, and you may also
want to add (or overrule) a categorical variable indicating the healthy/aneuploid
status based on the cutoff. Let's do that and show everything. 

```{r plot-aneuploidy}

allscore <- c(obsscore,refscore)
allscore <- allscore[ colnames(srat) ] # put in order of srat object.
srat <- AddMetaData(srat, col.name='aneuploidy_score', allscore)

cutoff <- 600 # based on the density plot

aneuploid <- ifelse( srat@meta.data$aneuploidy_score < cutoff, 'no', 'yes')
srat <- AddMetaData(srat, col.name='is_aneuploid', aneuploid)

## Let's show all we have. If it's too much information, leave some of it out.

p_plate <- DimPlot(srat, reduction = "umap", pt.size=0.5,
  group.by='plate_id')

p_patient <- DimPlot(srat, reduction = "umap", pt.size=0.5,
  group.by='patient')

p_celltype <- DimPlot(srat, reduction = "umap", pt.size=0.5,
  group.by='type2')

p_status <- DimPlot(srat, reduction = "umap", pt.size=0.5,
  group.by='type')

p_aneup <- FeaturePlot(srat, reduction = "umap", pt.size=0.5,
    features='aneuploidy_score',
    cols=CFG$gradient.colors, order=TRUE)

p_isaneup <- DimPlot(srat, reduction = "umap", pt.size=0.5,
  group.by='is_aneuploid')

 ( p_plate | p_patient | p_celltype ) / 
( p_status | p_aneup | p_isaneup )

```
